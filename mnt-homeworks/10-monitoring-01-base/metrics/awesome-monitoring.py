# /proc/loadavg
# The  first three fields in this file are load average figures giving the number of jobs in the run queue (state
#               R) or waiting for disk I/O (state D) averaged over 1, 5, and 15 minutes.  They are the same as the load average
#               numbers  given  by uptime(1) and other programs.  The fourth field consists of two numbers separated by a slash
#               (/).  The first of these is the number of currently runnable kernel scheduling entities  (processes,  threads).
#               The  value after the slash is the number of kernel scheduling entities that currently exist on the system.  The
#               fifth field is the PID of the process that was most recently created on the system.

# /proc/uptime
#       This file contains two numbers (values in seconds): the uptime of the system (including time spent  in  suspend)  and
#       the amount of time spent in the idle process.

# /proc/meminfo
#       This  file  reports  statistics about memory usage on the system.  It is used by free(1) to report the amount of free
#       and used memory (both physical and swap) on the system as well as the shared memory and buffers used by  the  kernel.
#       Each  line  of  the file consists of a parameter name, followed by a colon, the value of the parameter, and an option
#       unit of measurement (e.g., "kB").  The list below describes the parameter names and the format specifier required  to
#       read  the  field value.  Except as noted below, all of the fields have been present since at least Linux 2.6.0.  Some
#       fields are displayed only if the kernel was configured with various options; those  dependencies  are  noted  in  the
#       list.

# /proc/cpuinfo
#       This  is  a  collection  of  CPU and system architecture dependent items, for each supported architecture a different
#       list.  Two common entries are processor which gives CPU number and bogomips; a system  constant  that  is  calculated
#       during kernel initialization.  SMP machines have information for each CPU.  The lscpu(1) command gathers its informa‚Äê
#       tion from this file.
